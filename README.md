A Practice Site in Node 
======================

Although I use django/flask in general, I have been wanting to learn Node.js (and other js frameworks) for some time. 

This is a very simple website, and barely managed to scratch the surface of Node.  

Given the ubiquity of JS, learning node definitely helped in learning more JS. 

At the same time, Node is pretty new, and there might be relatively few libraries and apps compares to Django/Flask. Also, exisiting library maturity might not have not been tested. 

I will stick with Django/Flask in the meanwhile.
